# Front Matter

Front Matter is a list of key-value pairs that contain information about a document. It can be written in several languages; some of the more popular ones are:

- YAML
- TOML
- JavaScript

The front matter in these documents is written in YAML. Many people do not like to use front matter in their note-taking systems because it "hides" data. Other people don't like it because it distracts from writing the intended note. Others are perfectly happy to have the front matter just sit there.

Markdown editors generally take one of three approaches when it comes to markdown.
