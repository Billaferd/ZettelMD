# Front Matter

Front Matter is a list of key-value pairs that contain information about a document. It can be written in several languages; some of the more popular ones are:

- YAML
- TOML
- JavaScript

The front matter in these documents is written in YAML. Many people do not like to use front matter in their note-taking systems because of it "hides" data. Other people don't like it because it doesn't focus on writing the intended note.
