# Anatomy of a Note

Typically I see a note broken down into several parts. Not all of these are present all the time, but these are the general types that you will see.

## Title

Some people like to use the current date and time as a title, but I find it a bit too obtuse. I like to use a title that is easy to use in a sentence for easy wiki-style links.

There is also debate on where it should be stored. Some of the more popular options are the filename, the top level title,  or a property called title in the front matter.

## Overview

The overview section of a note is generally the first section and is usually the most consistent part. This section uses simple prose to describe the concept in very broad terms. Generally inline links are used to link out to more specific and supporting concepts. This is the type of note that most Zettelkasten guru's describe as a "good" note.
