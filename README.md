# ZettelMD

Just some thoughts and random musings on a general-purpose Markdown-powered Second-Brain and how I would want something to work ideally.

I have been using markdown files to take notes and gather my thoughts for a little while. I use [[VS Code]] and a handful of plugins, but I still feel that it lacks features that I really would love to have.

Some of my inspiration comes from several Markdown Extensions in VS Code and the shortcomings I experience using them. My musings are also coloured by my obsession with making linters happy. I do welcome conversation on the subject and none of these ideas are set in stone. I intend this to be a description of how I organize my life and discussion on how to make this method better and more approachable.
