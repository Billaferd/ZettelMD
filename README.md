Just some thought and random musings on a general-purpose Markdown-powered Second-Brain and how I would want something to work ideally.

I have been using markdown files to take notes and gather my thoughts for a little while. I use VS Code and a handful of plugins, but I still feel that it lacks features that I really would love to have.
